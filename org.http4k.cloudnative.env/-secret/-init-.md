`Secret(value: `[`String`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-string/index.html)`)``Secret(value: `[`ByteArray`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-byte-array/index.html)`)`

A secret is a value which tries very hard not to expose itself as a string, by storing it's value in a byte array. It is also able to be cleared after construction.
